    Accounting, finance, and taxation in Mexico are critical areas that demand accuracy 
    and constant scrutiny. Confirming accounting records is essential to ensure that all 
    financial transactions are properly documented and reflect the entity's economic reality. 
    Additionally, accounting calculations such as depreciation and amortization help distribute 
    asset costs over time, providing a more accurate view of their value and utility.
